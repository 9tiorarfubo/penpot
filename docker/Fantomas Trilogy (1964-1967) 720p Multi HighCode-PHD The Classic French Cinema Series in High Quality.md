If you are a fan of French cinema, you might have heard of Fantomas, a fictional character created by Marcel Allain and Pierre Souvestre in 1911. Fantomas is a master of disguise and a ruthless criminal who terrorizes Paris with his ingenious schemes and escapes. He is pursued by the brave but clumsy Inspector Juve and his journalist friend Fandor, who often impersonates Fantomas to expose his crimes.
 
In the 1960s, director Andr√É¬© Hunebelle adapted the Fantomas novels into a trilogy of films starring Jean Marais as both Fantomas and Fandor, and Louis de Fun√É¬®s as Inspector Juve. The films are a mix of comedy, action, and mystery, with spectacular stunts, gadgets, and costumes. The trilogy consists of Fantomas (1964), Fantomas Unleashed (1965), and Fantomas vs. Scotland Yard (1967). The films were hugely popular in France and abroad, and influenced many other spy and superhero movies.
