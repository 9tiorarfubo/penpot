The steps are:

1. Define the scope and objectives of PPA: The suppliers need to identify the products and processes that require PPA, and the customer-specific requirements that apply to them. They also need to define the objectives and criteria of PPA, such as the quality level, the sampling size, and the acceptance conditions.
2. Plan and prepare PPA: The suppliers need to plan and prepare the PPA activities, such as the selection of the production site, the allocation of resources, the scheduling of the PPA timeline, and the communication with the customers. They also need to prepare the necessary documents and records for PPA, such as the product specification, the process flow chart, the control plan, and the test plan.
3. Perform PPA: The suppliers need to perform the PPA activities according to the plan and the customer-specific requirements. They need to produce and test the samples from the production process, and record and analyze the results. They also need to verify and validate that the products and processes meet the specifications and expectations of the customers.
4. Document and submit PPA: The suppliers need to document and submit the PPA results to the customers for evaluation and decision. They need to use a standardized format for PPA documentation, such as the VDA Volume 2 Part 1 form or a customer-specific form. They also need to provide supporting evidence and information for PPA, such as test reports, certificates, photos, and drawings.
5. Evaluate and decide PPA: The customers need to evaluate and decide on the PPA results submitted by the suppliers. They need to check if the products and processes comply with their requirements and expectations, and if there are any deviations or non-conformities. They also need to communicate their decision and feedback to the suppliers, such as approval, conditional approval, or rejection.
6. Monitor and improve PPA: The suppliers need to monitor and improve their products and processes based on the PPA results and feedback from the customers. They need to implement corrective actions and preventive measures for any deviations or non-conformities identified during PPA. They also need to update their documents and records accordingly. They may also need to repeat or extend PPA if there are any changes or modifications in their products or processes.

VDA Band 2 provides detailed guidance and examples for each step of PPA. It also provides checklists and forms for PPA documentation and submission. The suppliers can use these tools to facilitate their PPA activities and ensure their compliance with VDA Band 2.
