Sigmaplot 13.0 is a software that helps you create various kinds of graphs and statistical plots using given data[^1^]. It can also be used to perform nonlinear regression analysis, which is useful for studying the effects of cocaine on enzyme activity. Cocaine is a psychoactive drug that inhibits several enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)[^2^]. By using Sigmaplot 13.0, you can fit your experimental data to different models of enzyme inhibition and determine the kinetic parameters of cocaine's action.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Sigmaplot 13.0 to analyze the data from a study that investigated the inhibition of MAO by cocaine[^3^]. MAO is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of monoamines, such as dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. Cocaine inhibits MAO in a first-order, nonlinear manner, meaning that the rate of inhibition depends on both the concentration of cocaine and the concentration of MAO[^2^]. The study measured the residual activity of MAO in rat brain homogenates after incubation with different concentrations of cocaine for various time intervals.

1. Open Sigmaplot 13.0 and create a new worksheet.
2. Enter the data from the study in the worksheet. The first column should contain the time intervals (in minutes), and the following columns should contain the residual activity of MAO (in percentage) for each concentration of cocaine (in micromolar). You can label the columns accordingly.
3. Select Analysis > Regression > Nonlinear Regression from the menu bar.
4. In the Nonlinear Regression dialog box, select User-Defined from the Category list and click New Equation.
5. In the Equation Editor dialog box, enter the following equation for first-order, nonlinear enzyme inhibition:

y = y0 \* exp(-k \* x)

where y is the residual activity of MAO, y0 is the initial activity of MAO, k is the rate constant of inhibition, and x is the concentration of cocaine.
6. Click OK to save the equation and return to the Nonlinear Regression dialog box.
7. Select Multiple Curves from the Fit To list and click Next.
8. In the next dialog box, select Time as the X column and select all the columns with MAO activity as Y columns. Click Next.
9. In the next dialog box, enter initial guesses for y0 and k for each curve. You can use trial and error or consult previous literature to find reasonable values. Click Next.
10. In the next dialog box, select Weighting > None and click Finish.
11. Sigmaplot 13.0 will fit your data to the equation and display the results in a new worksheet and a new graph window. You can view the fitted curves, the estimated parameters, and various statistics in these windows.
12. You can also customize your graph by adding titles, legends, axis labels, etc. using the Graph Tools toolbar or the Graph Properties dialog box.

By using Sigmaplot 13.0, you can easily analyze your data and obtain valuable insights into how cocaine affects enzyme activity. You can also apply this method to other types of enzyme inhibition models and other drugs that inhibit enzymes. Sigmaplot 13.0 is a powerful tool for exploring the pharmacological mechanisms of psychoactive substances.
