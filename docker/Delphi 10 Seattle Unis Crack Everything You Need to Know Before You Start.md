## Android Background Services Support
 
One of the new features of Delphi 10 Seattle is the support for Android background services. Background services are applications that run in the background without a user interface, and can perform tasks such as downloading data, playing music, or sending notifications. With Delphi 10 Seattle, you can create Android background services using the same language and framework as your main application, and deploy them as part of your APK file. You can also use the IDE to debug and monitor your background services.[^1^]
 
## FireDAC Support for MongoDB
 
Another new feature of Delphi 10 Seattle is the support for MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents. With FireDAC, Delphi's data access framework, you can easily connect to MongoDB servers, query and manipulate data using SQL-like commands, and bind data to visual components. FireDAC also supports other NoSQL databases such as Couchbase and Cassandra.[^1^]

## FireMonkey Controls zOrder Support for Windows
 
FireMonkey is Delphi's cross-platform framework for creating rich user interfaces with 2D and 3D graphics, animations, effects, and styles. One of the enhancements of FireMonkey in Delphi 10 Seattle is the support for zOrder property for Windows controls. The zOrder property determines the order in which controls are drawn on the screen, and can be used to create overlapping or transparent effects. For example, you can use zOrder to create a custom title bar with buttons that overlap the main form.[^1^]
 
## New TBeaconDevice Class
 
A beacon is a small device that emits a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal that can be detected by nearby devices. Beacons can be used for various purposes such as indoor navigation, proximity marketing, or location-based services. Delphi 10 Seattle introduces a new TBeaconDevice class that allows you to turn your device into a beacon on any of the supported platforms (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android). You can use the TBeaconDevice class to configure your device's UUID, major and minor values, transmission power, and advertising interval.[^1^]
 
## StyleViewer for Windows 10 Style in Bitmap Style Designer
 
The Bitmap Style Designer is a tool that allows you to create and edit custom styles for your FireMonkey applications. A style is a set of graphical elements that define the appearance of controls and components. Delphi 10 Seattle includes a new Windows 10 style that matches the look and feel of the latest Windows operating system. You can use the StyleViewer tool in the Bitmap Style Designer to preview how your application will look with the Windows 10 style on different devices and resolutions.[^1^]
 
## High-DPI Awareness and 4K Monitors Support
 
Delphi 10 Seattle also improves the support for high-DPI awareness and 4K monitors. High-DPI awareness means that your application can adapt to different screen resolutions and pixel densities without losing quality or clarity. 4K monitors are displays that have a resolution of at least 3840 x 2160 pixels, which offer more detail and sharpness than standard monitors. With Delphi 10 Seattle, you can enable high-DPI awareness for your VCL applications by setting a single property in the project options. You can also use FireMonkey's multi-resolution styles to create applications that look great on any screen size and resolution.[^2^]
 
## Windows 10 Styles
 
In addition to the Windows 10 style for FireMonkey applications, Delphi 10 Seattle also includes two new styles for VCL applications: Windows 10 Blue and
