## What is an Optocoupler?
 
An optocoupler, also known as an optoisolator or a photocoupler, is a device that uses light to transfer electrical signals between two isolated circuits. It consists of an infrared LED (light-emitting diode) and a photodetector, such as a phototransistor, a photodiode, or a photoresistor. The LED emits light when a voltage is applied to it, and the photodetector receives the light and converts it back to an electrical signal. This way, the input and output circuits are electrically isolated from each other, preventing noise interference, voltage spikes, or ground loops.
  
## What is the Orient 817c?
 
The Orient 817c is a type of optocoupler that uses a phototransistor as the photodetector. It has four pins: two for the LED (anode and cathode) and two for the phototransistor (collector and emitter). The LED and the phototransistor are housed in a DIP-4 (dual in-line package) plastic case that provides high insulation resistance and high breakdown voltage. The Orient 817c can operate at a wide range of input currents and output voltages, making it suitable for various applications such as power supply circuits, logic circuits, signal transmission circuits, and relay driving circuits.

- High isolation voltage: The Orient 817c can withstand up to 5000 Vrms (root mean square) between the input and output terminals, ensuring high safety and protection for your circuits.
- High current transfer ratio: The current transfer ratio (CTR) is the ratio of the output current to the input current. The higher the CTR, the more efficient the optocoupler is. The Orient 817c has a CTR of 50% to 600% at an input current of 5 mA and an output voltage of 5 V.
- High collector-emitter voltage: The collector-emitter voltage (Vce) is the maximum voltage that can be applied across the phototransistor. The higher the Vce, the more robust the optocoupler is. The Orient 817c has a Vce of 80 V.
- Low saturation voltage: The saturation voltage (Vce(sat)) is the voltage across the phototransistor when it is fully turned on. The lower the Vce(sat), the less power dissipation and heat generation in the optocoupler. The Orient 817c has a Vce(sat) of 0.4 V at an input current of 20 mA and an output current of 1 mA.
- Fast switching speed: The switching speed of an optocoupler is determined by two parameters: the rise time (tr) and the fall time (tf). The rise time is the time it takes for the output signal to rise from 10% to 90% of its maximum value when the input signal turns on. The fall time is the time it takes for the output signal to fall from 90% to 10% of its maximum value when the input signal turns off. The faster the switching speed, the more responsive the optocoupler is. The Orient 817c has a tr of 4 Î¼s and a tf of 3 Î¼s at an input current of 16 mA and an output load resistance of 100 Î©.
