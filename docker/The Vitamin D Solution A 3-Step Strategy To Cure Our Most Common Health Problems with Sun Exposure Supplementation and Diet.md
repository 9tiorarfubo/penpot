Do you suffer from chronic pain, fatigue, depression, or autoimmune disorders? If so, you might be one of the millions of people who are deficient in vitamin D, the "sunshine vitamin". Vitamin D is essential for many aspects of our health, from bone strength to immune function to mood regulation. However, due to our modern lifestyle, many of us do not get enough exposure to natural sunlight, which is the best source of vitamin D. As a result, we are at risk of developing various diseases and conditions that could be prevented or treated with adequate vitamin D levels.

## Why Vitamin D Is So Important
 
Vitamin D is not really a vitamin, but a hormone that regulates many functions in our body. It is produced by our skin when exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from the sun. It then travels to the liver and kidneys, where it is converted into its active form, called calcitriol. Calcitriol binds to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) in various tissues and organs, and influences their gene expression and activity.
 
Vitamin D is crucial for maintaining normal levels of calcium and phosphorus in our blood, which are essential for bone health. It also helps modulate our immune system, preventing infections and autoimmune diseases. It also affects our brain, nervous system, muscles, heart, blood vessels, pancreas, skin, and reproductive organs. It plays a role in regulating our mood, sleep, appetite, metabolism, and inflammation. In short, vitamin D is involved in almost every aspect of our health.
 
## How Much Vitamin D Do We Need
 
The amount of vitamin D we need depends on several factors, such as our age, skin color, latitude, season, sun exposure, diet, and health status. The current recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is 600 IU (15 mcg) for adults up to 70 years old, and 800 IU (20 mcg) for those over 70. However, Dr. Holick argues that this is too low to achieve optimal health benefits. He suggests that most adults need at least 2000 IU (50 mcg) of vitamin D per day, and some may need up to 4000 IU (100 mcg) or more.
 
The best way to determine your optimal vitamin D dose is to test your blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), which is the main form of vitamin D circulating in our body. This test can be done by your doctor or by a home kit that you can order online. Dr. Holick recommends aiming for a 25(OH)D level of at least 40 ng/ml (100 nmol/L), and preferably between 50 and 80 ng/ml (125 and 200 nmol/L). This range is associated with the lowest risk of disease and the highest level of well-being.
 
## How To Get More Vitamin D
 
The most natural and effective way to get more vitamin D is to expose your skin to sunlight or a safe indoor tanning device that emits UVB rays. Dr. Holick advises getting about 15 minutes of midday sun exposure on your arms and legs or face and hands, two or three times a week, without sunscreen or clothing. This can produce up to 10,000 IU (250 mcg) of vitamin D in your body. However, you should avoid getting sunburned or overexposed, as this can damage your skin and increase your risk of skin cancer.
 
If you live in a place where sunlight is scarce or unreliable, or if you have a darker skin tone that reduces your vitamin D production, you may need to supplement with oral vitamin D3 pills or drops. Dr. Holick recommends taking vitamin D3 rather than vitamin D2, as it is more potent and longer-lasting in your body. He also suggests taking it with a meal that contains some fat, as this can enhance its absorption and effectiveness.
 
In addition to sun exposure and supplementation, you can also get some vitamin D from your diet. However, food sources of vitamin D are limited and often insufficient to meet your needs. Some of the foods that contain vitamin D are fatty fish (such as salmon, tuna, mackerel), egg yolks, liver, cheese, mushrooms (especially if exposed to UV light), and fortified foods (such as milk, orange juice, cereal). Dr. Holick recommends eating these foods regularly but not relying on them as your sole source of vitamin D.
