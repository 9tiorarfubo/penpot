Tropico 2 Il Covo Dei Pirati is a simulation and strategy game that was released in 2003 for PC and Mac. The game is a sequel to Tropico, but with a different setting and gameplay. Instead of playing as a dictator of a banana republic, the player takes the role of a pirate king who rules over a secret island populated by pirates and captives. The player must manage the economy, the needs and the morale of the pirates, as well as build ships and send them out to raid and plunder the ships and settlements of the Spanish, English and French colonial powers.
 
The game features 60 different buildings, 16 scenarios, a sandbox mode, and a map editor. The game also has a humorous tone and a colorful graphics style that evoke the atmosphere of the Caribbean Sea in the 17th century. The game was developed by Frog City Software and published by various companies, including Gathering of Developers, Take-Two Interactive, and Novitas Publishing. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its originality, variety, and replay value, but also noted some technical issues and balance problems.
