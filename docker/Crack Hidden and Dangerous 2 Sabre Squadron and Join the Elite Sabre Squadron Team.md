Hidden and Dangerous 2: Sabre Squadron is an expansion pack for the World War II tactical shooter game Hidden and Dangerous 2. It adds nine new missions, new weapons, vehicles, and enemies to the original game. However, if you want to play it without having to insert the CD every time, you will need a crack file that bypasses the SecuROM protection.
 
A crack file is a modified version of the game's executable file that allows you to run it without checking for the CD. You can download a crack file for Hidden and Dangerous 2: Sabre Squadron v1.12 from various websites, such as [GameCopyWorld](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_hidden_and_dangerous_2.shtml) or [MegaGames](https://megagames.com/download/263966/0). Make sure you download the correct version that matches your game's patch level.

To use the crack file, follow these steps:
 
1. Backup your original game executable file (HD2\_SabreSquadron.exe) in case you want to restore it later.
2. Extract the crack file from the zip archive and copy it to your game's installation folder, overwriting the original file.
3. Run the game as usual. You should be able to play without inserting the CD.

Note that using a crack file may have some drawbacks, such as preventing you from playing online or updating the game. Also, some antivirus programs may detect the crack file as a virus or a trojan, so you may need to disable them or add an exception for the file. Use the crack file at your own risk and only if you own a legitimate copy of the game.
  
Some of the new missions are based on historical events, such as the rescue of prisoners of war from a German castle, the sabotage of a bridge in Sicily, and the assault on a radar station in France. Others are more fictional, such as the infiltration of a secret Nazi base in Libya, where you discover a prototype rocket launcher. The missions are varied and challenging, requiring stealth, strategy, and teamwork. You can choose from different difficulty levels and customize your squad's equipment and skills before each mission.
 
The real draw of Sabre Squadron's offerings is the chance to play its new missions cooperatively. You can join up to three other players online and take on the roles of different squad members. This way, you can coordinate your actions and tactics more effectively, and avoid the frustration of dealing with the unreliable AI. The cooperative mode also adds replay value to the game, as you can try different approaches and strategies with your friends. The game also supports voice communication, so you can communicate with your teammates in real time.

They offer different layouts and terrain features that can affect your combat style and tactics. The multiplayer mode supports up to 32 players online or over a LAN network.
 
Sabre Squadron also adds some new weapons and vehicles to the game. You can wield new firearms such as the Sten gun, the Bren gun, the Lee Enfield rifle, and the Panzerschreck rocket launcher. You can also drive new vehicles such as Sherman tanks, jeeps, motorcycles with sidecars, and trucks. The new weapons and vehicles add some variety and fun to the game, but they don't significantly change the gameplay or balance.
