# What is the Weliamuna Report and How Did It Affect SriLankan Airlines?
 
The Weliamuna Report is a document that was commissioned by the former Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation, Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, in February 2015, to investigate allegations of corruption, mismanagement and abuse of power at SriLankan Airlines, the national carrier of Sri Lanka. The report was prepared by a board of inquiry headed by attorney-at-law J.C. Weliamuna, and it contained several findings and recommendations based on a preliminary investigation.
 
The report revealed that SriLankan Airlines had suffered huge losses due to irregularities in the procurement or leasing of aircraft, external interferences in the operations of the airline, and abuse of power by the previous board of directors and senior management. The report also identified several individuals who were allegedly involved in these malpractices and suggested legal action against them.

The report was submitted to the Cabinet Sub Committee on Economic Affairs in July 2015, and some of the cases were referred to the Bribery Commission, CID and FCID for further investigation. The current board of directors of SriLankan Airlines also took steps to address the internal issues and disciplinary issues highlighted in the report, and submitted a comprehensive response to the authorities. The response was also made public on the official website of SriLankan Airlines[^1^].

However, the Weliamuna Report has been subject to criticism and controversy from various parties, who have questioned its credibility, accuracy and impartiality. Some have claimed that the report was politically motivated and biased against certain individuals or groups. Others have argued that the report did not cover all aspects of the problems faced by SriLankan Airlines, and that it did not provide sufficient evidence or details to support its allegations.
 
The Weliamuna Report has also been challenged in court by some of the individuals who were named in it, seeking injunctions or damages for defamation. The outcome of these cases is still pending. Meanwhile, SriLankan Airlines continues to face financial difficulties and operational challenges amid the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors affecting the global aviation industry.
 
The Weliamuna Report is a significant document that exposed some of the issues that plagued SriLankan Airlines for years, and prompted some reforms and actions to improve its performance and governance. However, it is also a contentious document that has sparked debates and disputes among various stakeholders and observers. The full impact and implications of the report are yet to be seen.
  
In addition to the Weliamuna Report, SriLankan Airlines has also faced other challenges and opportunities in recent years. The airline has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely reduced the demand for air travel and disrupted the operations of the global aviation industry. SriLankan Airlines has taken various measures to cope with the crisis, such as reducing its workforce, renegotiating its debt obligations, and operating special flights for repatriation and cargo purposes.
 
Despite the difficulties, SriLankan Airlines has also shown resilience and innovation in its efforts to recover and grow. The airline has resumed flights to some of its key destinations, such as China, India and the Middle East, and has expanded its network to new markets, such as Kazakhstan and Russia. The airline has also enhanced its digital capabilities, such as launching a new and improved mobile app, and offering online check-in and contactless boarding services.
 
Furthermore, SriLankan Airlines has played an active role in promoting Sri Lanka as a tourism destination and a MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) hub. The airline has partnered with various stakeholders, such as the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau, and the Entrepreneurs' Organization Nepal, to organize and host events that showcase the country's attractions and potential. The airline has also supported social and environmental causes, such as providing aid to children in need, hosting a British naturalist for a documentary project, and sponsoring a women's adventure race.
 
SriLankan Airlines is a vital asset for Sri Lanka's economy and society, as it connects the island nation with the rest of the world and contributes to its development and prosperity. The Weliamuna Report was a wake-up call for the airline to address its issues and improve its performance and governance. However, it was not the end of the story. SriLankan Airlines has faced many challenges and opportunities since then, and it continues to strive for excellence and innovation in a dynamic and competitive industry.
