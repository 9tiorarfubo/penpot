ReSharper offers a convenient solution for corporate clients who need to manage and distribute license tickets among their employees. By using JetBrains License Server, enterprises can set up a pool of product licenses with either limited or unlimited seats and share them within the corporate network. The advantage of this solution is that the license tickets are not tied to specific users or machines. Instead, they are automatically returned to the server when the user closes the application, making them available for other users who need them.
  
To use JetBrains License Server, corporate clients need to install and configure it on a machine that is accessible from the corporate network. The server can be accessed through a web interface that allows administrators to view and manage license tickets, monitor license usage, and generate reports. The server also supports integration with Active Directory and LDAP for user authentication and authorization.

Users who want to use ReSharper need to connect to the server and request a license ticket. The server will check if there are any available licenses in the pool and grant one to the user if possible. The user can then use ReSharper without any restrictions until they close the application or their session expires. The server will automatically reclaim the license ticket and make it available for other users. Users can also manually return their license tickets if they don't need them anymore.
  
JetBrains License Server is a flexible and secure way of managing and distributing license tickets for ReSharper and other JetBrains products. It helps corporate clients save costs, reduce administrative overhead, and ensure compliance with licensing terms.
